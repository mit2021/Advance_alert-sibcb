piRNA-independent function of PIWIL1 as a co-activator for anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome to drive pancreatic cancer metastasis(胰腺癌转移).

Piwi proteins are normally restricted in germ cells to suppress transposons through associations with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), but they are also frequently activated in many types of human cancers. A great puzzle is the lack of significant induction（归纳） of corresponding piRNAs in cancer cells, as we document here in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs，人胰腺导管腺癌), which implies that such germline-specific proteins are somehow hijacked to promote tumorigenesis through a different mode of action. Here, we show that in the absence of piRNAs, human PIWIL1 in PDAC functions as an oncoprotein（癌蛋白） by activating the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 complex, which then targets a critical cell adhesion-related protein（黏附相关蛋白）, Pinin, to enhance PDAC metastasis. This is in contrast to piRNA-dependent PIWIL1 ubiquitination and removal by APC/C during late spermiogenesis. These findings unveil a piRNA-dependent mechanism to switch PIWIL1 from a substrate（基质） in spermatids（精子细胞） to a co-activator of APC/C in human cancer cells.

Piwi proteins are germline-specific **Argonaute family**  members1 that are essential for germline development and gametogenesis（配子发生） in animals2–8. Increasing evidence shows that Piwi proteins, in complex with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)9–12, silence transposable elements（沉默转座元件/因子） and preserve genome integrity（保持基因组完整性） in animal germlines13–16. We and others have shown that Piwi proteins and piRNAs also regulate protein-coding genes in germ cells16–28. The human genome contains four PIWI paralogues, including PIWIL1 (also known as HIWI), PIWIL2 (also known as HILI), PIWIL3 and PIWIL4 (also known as HIWI2)29, all of which are primarily expressed in testes. However, PIWIL1 and PIWIL2 are also aberrantly（异常/反常） induced in various types of human cancers30,31. This exemplifies the induction of a large variety of testis-restricted genes in human cancers, which are collectively referred to as cancer testis antigens32（睾丸癌抗原）.

In contrast to the great advances in our understanding of the functions of Piwi in germlines(种系), their actions in cancer cells remain less clear. In particular, Piwi proteins have been asserted as oncoproteins30,31, but little is known about how their oncogenic function（致癌功能） is achieved in cancer cells. It is hypothesized（假设）that PIWIL1 and PIWIL2, guided by piRNAs, induce aberrant（异常） DNA methylation in cancer cells, thereby transcriptionally silencing tumour suppressor genes31,33,34. However, whether cancer cells express corresponding piRNAs has remained an open question, as it has been largely unknown whether the piRNA-like small RNAs in cancer cells are indeed associated with Piwi proteins and contain signature 2′-O-methylation modifications at their 3′ end. Additionally, piRNA biogenesis requires a number of germline-specific factors14,16, but whether such factors are coordinately（同等地/并列地） induced in cancer cells remains unsubstantiated（无确凿证据）.Therefore, there is no strong evidence for the activation of an entire piRNA biogenesis（生物起源） programme in cancers, which raises the intriguing possibility（有趣地可能性） that certain selectively activated Piwi proteins might function in a piRNA-independent manner in cancer cells.

In the present study, we found that PIWIL1, but not piRNAs, is aberrantly expressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC，人胰腺导管腺癌) cells. We have previously shown that piRNA-loaded PIWIL1 is ubiquitinated（泛素） and removed by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)–ubiquitin (Ub) pathway in spermatids35. Intriguingly（有趣地）, here we reveal that unliganded（未配对） PIWIL1 acts as a co-activator of APC/C to promote PDAC metastasis. The primary function of APC/C is to govern cell cycle progression（细胞周期进程） through the proteasomedependent degradation（蛋白酶体依赖性降解） of key cell cycle regulators, such as cyclins and CDK inhibitors36–38. Importantly, its activity is tightly controlled by co-activators (such as CDC20 and CDH1)36–38, while its dysregulation(失调) has been implicated in multiple human diseases, including cancers39. We further demonstrate that the proteolysis（蛋白水解） of the cell–cell adhesion protein Pinin (encoded by PNN)40,41 by APC/CPIWIL1 is functionally required for PIWIL1-induced PDAC metastasis. These findings reveal an unprecedented oncogenic mechanism（前所未有的致癌机制） by which an abnormally induced Piwi protein in human cancers promotes metastasis after switching its role from a substrate to a co-activator of APC/C.
